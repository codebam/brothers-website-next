			<h1>Brothers International Community</h1>
			<h2>Join brothers community</h2>
			<h3>Build trustworthy international connections</h3>
			<div id="summary">
				<p>
					We are a group of Brothers, who created this community and selfishly
					named it after the brotherly relationship we share.
				</p>

				<p>
					First of all, ‘Brothers’ is considered a gender neutral term in our
					community, man or woman, you’re equal in our community. We use this
					single term to represent all of us regardless of our gender, ethnicity
					and any other differences. We believe that the gender neutral word
					also filters away any undesirable gender attraction it may cause, thus
					creating a pure relationship of family we can trust and feel safe upon
					while amongst strangers.
				</p>

				<p>
					We’ve always dreamt to create a community of trustworthy people
					working together and helping each other out. But we realised that in
					this hectic world, everyone is out for themselves and not many are
					interested in building relationships that doesn’t benefit them
					somehow.
				</p>

				<p>
					Tasting the sweetness of this camaraderie, we understood how hard it
					is to build such bonds.
				</p>

				<p>
					People tend to forget that they’re amassing wealth and positions for
					happiness and peace in life. While our community believes that true
					happiness and peace in life exists due to the people who really cares
					for us around us. Thus building good people to live together with is
					also essential for us to remain happy just as much as how we need
					wealth and status.
				</p>

				<p>
					In practical life many are forced to abandon their good relationships
					afraid that they won’t benefit from it in the long run. We abandon
					people who were once very close to us because they aren’t equal to us
					anymore. Slowly we learn to build relations only due to the benefits
					they provide. Relationships become a trade of benefits rather than the
					genuine warmth they’re supposed to provide.
				</p>

				<p>
					While forsaking the relationships that don’t benefit us, we gradually
					grow selfish and are bothered about our life alone. And we slowly
					learn to relinquish our childhood innocence and the genuine concern we
					felt for the people around us. Our life gradually narrows down to a
					singular unit of ourselves, unable to gain back the ability to give
					warmth to others and to recieve it from others.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our dream is to create a community of Brothers who are genuine to each
					other and retain this warmth and concern between themselves so that
					all of us can live a content and peaceful life within such bonds.
				</p>

				<p>
					We believe that the majority of the people who join this community and
					seek it’s services may only look for their own personal benefits. Yet
					we created this platform as an initiation where we may meet people of
					similar interests, true Brothers who can work together and help each
					other out. Such bonds are more precious than any wealth we make.
					Creating such bonds require lots of effort by an individual. Thus we
					use this community as a medium to earn such people and bonds, to make
					a large web of people of such similar interests.
				</p>

				<p>
					Even finding a couple dozen sincere Brothers from the millions of
					members we may potentially acquire, shall fulfill our honest dream.
					Our community was solely created to find those couple dozen group of
					people.
				</p>

				<p>
					I believe nothing in this world can destroy the bonds of such a group
					of people. People of the pure heart, devoid of jealousy, selfishness,
					envy and pride amongst each other. People who show genuine brotherly
					concern for each other. People who are ready to adjust with others and
					don’t dominate others with their ego. People who don’t keep grudges
					towards each other. People who don’t trample others for their own
					personal status and ambitions.
				</p>

				<p>
					We hope that our initiation may rekindle the warmth and concern buried
					in people’s heart for one another and they soon reach out to each
					other as real brothers.
				</p>

				<p>
					We look forward to the future, concealed by a veil of fate and believe
					that our dream shall be fulfilled one day.
